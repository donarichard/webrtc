# WebRTC with Node.js and React

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the implementation of WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) using Node.js and React. WebRTC enables real-time audio, video, and data communication directly within web browsers and mobile applications.

## WebRTC Overview

WebRTC is a powerful technology that allows real-time communication over the internet. It enables peer-to-peer communication between web browsers and mobile applications, making it suitable for applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and more. Key features of WebRTC include:

- **Real-time Audio and Video**: WebRTC provides APIs to capture and stream audio and video in real-time, making it ideal for applications requiring live communication.

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: WebRTC establishes direct connections between peers, reducing latency and improving data transfer efficiency.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: WebRTC is supported by major web browsers and can be used in both web and mobile applications.

- **Security**: WebRTC incorporates encryption to ensure the privacy and security of user data during communication.

## Setting Up Node.js Project

To set up the Node.js project for WebRTC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donarichard/webrtc
   cd webrtc-server
   
2. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    
## Setting Up react Project

1. **Change diractory**: Change diractor to webrtc-app

   ```bash
   cd webrtc-app

2. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start   
3. Access the React App:

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to explore the React app.   

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of WebRTC in enabling real-time communication within web and mobile applications. By setting up the Node.js server and React client, you can build applications that leverage the capabilities of WebRTC for interactive and secure communication.
